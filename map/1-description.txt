You stand in front of the door. What is this place? No one knows.
Anyway, there is just nothing except this door. That place is dark and empty.
You hear nothing, except your heart beating, and blood flowing inside you.
That quietness just makes you feel disoriented. One more minute,
and you will literally go crazy! Set yourself free, quick!
