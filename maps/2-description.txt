You entered, and ended up at the field near the sea.
In front of you is a great lighthouse, and it seems that
it has been standing here for a very long time.
After some wandering in the surroundings you've found and
picked up a [bottle]. Looks like there is some paper
inside. At the #left near the field you can see
some building. At the #right there is an endless sea.
Actions: inspect bottle; go left; go right
