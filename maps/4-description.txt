You fully examined a bottle, but not found anything interesting,
except a big red label on it, saying 'Schlitz'. You've decided
to open it. What a stink... you opened a bottle and picked a
piece of paper from it. The text on paper says:
NfzP4YCG1Tv86Joik9Nuh/iHcVnngRL8EZdV4YLAw6Cyl/gPYfckI/yKNg==
Don't know what it means. Anyway, you've put bottle in your
backpack.
Actions: go back
